{"id":1,"start_time":60,"end_time":120.0,"clip_name":"content\/clips\/clip_1.mp4","frame_name":"content\/frames\/frame_1.png","description":"The video starts with a man standing on a stage in front of a large screen. The screen displays four photos of a young girl, presumably his daughter Lucia. He begins talking about using Google Photos to track his daughter Lucia's early milestones. He gives an example of asking Google Photos to \"show me how Lucia's swimming has progressed\". The screen then transitions to show a phone screen with the same question typed in the Google Photos app. The screen then transitions again to show a rapid slideshow of photos of Lucia swimming. The photos are shown in a diagonal stack, scrolling from bottom to top. The photos transition to a summary of six photos of Lucia swimming. The screen then transitions back to the phone screen, this time showing the summary of photos with a text description below. The man then continues talking, explaining that Google built Gemini to be multimodal from the ground up. The screen behind him transitions to show a blue background with four icons, representing text, images, video, and audio. He explains that it's one model with all the modalities built in. The man continues, explaining that they have been gradually rolling out Gemini 1.5 Pro with long context in preview over the last few months. The screen behind him transitions to show a grid of the same four icons from before, this time in blue and white. The grid then transitions to show a large \"2M\" in the center, with the word \"tokens\" below and \"Gemini 1.5 Pro\" above. The man continues, stating that today they are expanding the context window to 2 million tokens. The audience begins clapping and cheering. The screen transitions to black. The man continues speaking, stating that so far they have talked about two technical advances: multimodality and long context. The screen behind him transitions to show the words \"Multimodality\" and \"Long Context\" on the left and right side of the screen, respectively. An icon is displayed next to each word. He explains that each is powerful on its own, but together they unlock deeper capabilities and more intelligence. The man concludes by asking \"What if we could go even further?\". \n\nThe video features one subject:\n\nThe subject is a man with short, dark hair, a short beard and mustache, and is wearing glasses. He is wearing a gray button-up shirt with the sleeves rolled up to his elbows. He is standing on a stage in front of a large screen. He appears to be giving a presentation about Google's new AI model, Gemini. He is smiling and appears to be enthusiastic about the topic.

They are clapping their hands and smiling. The video then cuts to a woman with short, curly brown hair standing on a stage in front of a large screen. She is wearing a black blazer over a purple shirt. The screen behind her is blank.\n\nThe woman says, \"All the advancements you'll see today are made possible by a new Gemini model customized for Google Search.

{"id":7,"start_time":420,"end_time":480.0,"clip_name":"content\/clips\/clip_7.mp4","frame_name":"content\/frames\/frame_7.png","description":"The video starts with a woman standing on a stage in front of a large screen. The screen displays five images: a location pin icon, a cityscape, an airplane icon, a sunset over water, and a building.\n\nThe woman says: \"to prioritize and make decisions. That reasoning and intelligence all come together in the new trip planning experience in Gemini Advanced.\"\n\nThe video then cuts to a man with a beard and a black hoodie standing in front of a blue and white background. He says: \"We've embarked on a multi-year journey to reimagine Android with AI at the core.\"\n\nThe video cuts back to the stage, where a different man is now standing behind a podium. A large screen behind him displays a message that reads \"Good morning. Type, talk, or share a photo.\"\n\nThe man behind the podium says: \"Now, we're making Gemini context aware, so it can anticipate what you're trying to do and provide more helpful suggestions in the moment. Let me show you how this works. So, my friend Pete is asking me if I want to play pickleball this weekend, but I'm new to this pickleball thing, and I can bring up Gemini to help with that. Gemini knows I'm looking at a video, so it proactively shows me an ask this video chip. So let me tap on that, and now I can ask specific questions about the video. So for example, uh, what is the two bounce rule? So give it a moment, and there. I get a nice, distinct answer.\"\n\nThe video then shows a close-up of the man's phone screen. The screen displays a YouTube video titled \"How to Play Pickleball (THE BASICS).\" A chat box at the bottom of the screen shows the man's question, \"what is the two bounce rule,\" and Gemini's response, \"According to the video, the two bounce rule is standard to serving in pickleball. After the serving drive is struck, the ball must bounce once on the returner's side then bounce once more on the server's side before you can start volleying. You can volley the ball from anywhere on the court except for from the kitchen.\"\n\nThe video cuts back to the man, who says: \"Starting with Pixel later this year, we'll be expanding.\"\n\n## Subject Descriptions:\n\n**Woman 1:**\n\n* **Appearance:** Asian woman with long, dark hair. She is wearing a light brown blazer over a white shirt and black pants.\n* **Emotion:** She appears to be confident and enthusiastic.\n* **Actions:** She is standing on a stage and speaking to an audience.\n\n**Man 1:**\n\n* **Appearance:** Middle-aged man with a beard and short, dark hair.

{"id":9,"start_time":540,"end_time":598.05,"clip_name":"content\/clips\/clip_9.mp4","frame_name":"content\/frames\/frame_9.png","description":"The video starts with a man giving a presentation on a stage in front of a large audience. The stage has a large screen behind it. The screen displays the words \"Building AI responsibly\".\n\nThe video then cuts to the man standing in front of a blue and white background. He is talking about how Google is improving its AI models.\n\nThe man on the stage is wearing a light brown overshirt over a black shirt and black pants. He is bald and has a short beard. He is wearing glasses and has a microphone clipped to his shirt. He appears to be passionate about the topic he is presenting.\n\nThe man says: \"for people and society. We're improving our models with an industry standard practice called red teaming, in which we test our own models and try to break them to identify weaknesses. I'm excited to introduce LearnAlam, our new family of models based on Gemini and fine-tuned for learning. Another example is a new feature in YouTube that uses LearnAlam to make educational videos more interactive, allowing you to ask a clarifying question, get a helpful explanation, or take a quiz.\"\n\nAs he speaks, the screen behind him changes to display the words \"Red Teaming\" and then \"LearnLM\". A video then plays on the screen showing a phone with an interactive quiz about a coding tutorial video.\n\nThe video then cuts to a different man standing in front of the same blue and white background. This man is wearing a gray button-down shirt. He is also wearing glasses and has a microphone clipped to his shirt. He has short, dark hair and a short beard. He is smiling and appears to be pleased with the progress that has been made.\n\nThe second man says: \"All of this shows the important progress we have made as we take a bold and responsible approach to making AI helpful for everyone. To everyone here in Shoreline and the millions more watching around the world, here's to the possibilities ahead and creating them together. Thank you.\"\n\nThe video then cuts back to the stage, where the second man is now standing. He waves to the audience as they applaud. The video ends with a shot of the Google logo.
