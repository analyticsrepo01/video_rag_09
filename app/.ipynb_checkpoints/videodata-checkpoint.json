{"id":1,"start_time":60,"end_time":120.0,"clip_name":"content\/clips\/clip_1.mp4","frame_name":"content\/frames\/frame_1.png","description":"The video starts with a man standing on a stage in front of a large screen. The screen displays four photos of a young girl. The man begins to speak about his daughter, Lucia, and her early milestones. He then transitions to talking about the Google Photos app and how users can ask it questions about their photos. A simulation of the app is shown on the screen, where a user types in the question, \"show me how Lucia's swimming has progressed.\" The app then displays a collection of photos and videos of Lucia swimming. The man explains that this feature, called Gemini, goes beyond a simple search by recognizing different contexts and packaging the photos together in a summary.\n\nThe scene then shifts to a different stage with a different screen and a different audience. The man on stage is the same as before. He continues talking about Gemini, explaining that it is multimodal from the ground up and has all modalities built in. He mentions that they have been gradually rolling out Gemini 1.5 Pro with long context and preview over the last few months. The screen behind him displays a grid of icons representing different modalities. The man announces that they are expanding the context window to 2 million tokens, which elicits applause from the audience.\n\nThe scene changes back to the first stage with the first screen. The man recaps the two technical advances they have discussed: multimodality and long context. He emphasizes that while each is powerful on its own, together they unlock deeper capabilities and more intelligence. The screen displays the words \"Multimodality\" and \"Long Context\" alongside their respective icons. The man concludes by asking, \"What if we could go even further?\"\n\n**Detailed Descriptions:**\n\n**Man on Stage:**\n\n* **Appearance:** The man has short, dark hair with a receding hairline and a short, neatly trimmed beard.

He speaks with a clear voice and maintains eye contact with the audience. He gestures with his hands to emphasize his points.\n* **Actions:** The man stands confidently on stage, addressing the audience.

{"id":2,"start_time":120,"end_time":180.0,"clip_name":"content\/clips\/clip_2.mp4","frame_name":"content\/frames\/frame_2.png","description":"The video starts with Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google, talking about AI agents. He describes them as intelligent systems that show reasoning, planning, and memory. He says they are able to think multiple steps ahead, work across software and systems, all to get something done on your behalf, and most importantly, under your supervision.\n\nThe next speaker is a bald man with glasses wearing a blue sweater. He announces exciting new progress about the future of AI assistants that they are calling Project Astra. He says they wanted to build a universal AI agent that can be truly helpful in everyday life. He introduces a video of their prototype, which has two parts, each part captured in a single take in real-time.\n\nThe video shows a person holding a smartphone in front of a computer screen displaying code. The person asks, \"What does that part of the code do?\" A moment later, a response appears on the screen, \"This code defines encryption and decryption functions.\" The person asks another question, \"It seems to use AES-CBC encryption to encode and decode data based on a key and an initialization vector (IV)?\"\n\nHere are the details of the subjects in the video:\n\n**Sundar Pichai:**\n* **Appearance:** Wears a gray button-down shirt, glasses, and has short, dark hair and a beard.\n* **Emotion:** Appears calm and confident.\n* **Actions:** Stands still with his hands clasped in front of him while speaking.\n\n**Second Speaker:**\n* **Appearance:** Bald head, wearing glasses and a blue sweater. He also wears a watch on his left wrist.\n* **Emotion:** Appears enthusiastic and passionate about the project.\n* **Actions:** Uses hand gestures while speaking.\n\n**Person in the Prototype Video:**\n* **Appearance:** Only hands are visible, holding a smartphone.\n* **Emotion:** Unknown.\n* **Actions:** Holds the smartphone steady, points at the code on the screen, and presumably speaks

She is wearing a light brown blazer over a white shirt and black pants. She is smiling and gesturing with her hands as she speaks.\n\n**Woman:** AI is delivering our most intelligent AI experience. We're rolling out a new feature that lets you customize it for your own needs and create personal experts on any topic you want. We're calling these Gems. They're really simple to set up. Just tap to create a Gem, write your instructions once, and come back whenever you need it. Starting today, Gemini Advanced subscribers get access to Gemini 1.5 Pro with 1 million tokens. That is the longest context window of any chatbot in the world. You can upload a PDF up to 1,500 pages long or multiple files to get insights across a project. Now, we all know that chatbots can give you ideas for your next vacation, but there's a lot more that goes into planning a great trip. It requires reasoning that considers space-time logistics and the intelligence...\n\nThe screen behind her changes to show a blue and purple four-pointed star on a black background. The word \"Gems\" appears in a gradient of blue and purple. A white pill-shaped button with the text \"+ Create Gem\" appears and is pressed, turning blue. A dark gray box with rounded corners appears with the title \"New Gem\" in the top left corner. It has a text field for \"Name\" and a larger text field for \"Instructions\" with the text \"I'd like you to act as a storyteller who specializes in crafting short stories with mysterious twists\" already entered. Below the \"Instructions\" field is a light gray button with the text \"Generate instructions\". The screen then transitions to a grid pattern with three squares in a gradient of blue and purple appearing in different locations on the grid.\n\nThe woman is then shown standing on a stage in front of a large screen.

The screen then transitions to a black background with the text \"Tokens\" in white at the top. Below the text are four rectangles, each with a different color outline and text inside. The top rectangle has a blue outline, is mostly filled with a pink bar, and has the text \"1M Gemini Advanced\" inside. The second rectangle has a white outline and the text \"200K Claude 3\" inside. The third rectangle has a white outline and the text \"128K GPT-4\" inside. The bottom rectangle has a white outline and the text \"32K Gemini app\" inside.\n\nThe screen behind the woman changes to show a graphic of a document with the text \"1,500 pages\" below it. The graphic then changes to show four documents stacked on top of each other. The audience is then shown clapping their hands.\n\nThe woman is then shown standing on a stage in front of a large screen.
